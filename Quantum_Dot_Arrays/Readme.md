# Quantum dot arrays

Quantum Dot Arrays.
This project is one of the research projects I worked on in my undergraduate research. 
Though it has not been published, this project has been a great learning experience
in :
different methodologies in computational research,
monty carlo markov chains
visualization , Guis, and general widespread use of different functionallities in matlab.
I hope these files my be of assistnace to others.


The Abstract below may provide a better understanding of the context of this project and its original goals.

Abstract

In recent years there has been a rise of interest in the transport behavior observed 
in arrays of quantum dots. These mesoscopic electronic systems exibit Exotic transport behaviors,
such as switching IV hysteresis loops, Coulomb staircase, anomalous metallic phases.
Though much experimental work has been doen, there has not been much success to at generating a 
coherent theory which explians these phenomena.
In this work, we present a computational model which attempts to provide a microscopic description 
of these effects that generate these transport properties.
This was done by simulating capacitively coupled quantum dots in the an open system, with various types of disorder. 
We focus on reproducing the phenomena that is observed in low temperature metallic dot arrays, 
as a basis of future work on such superconducting arrays.
Our results show that the coulumv staircases observed in single dot systems, break down under certain types of disorder. 
Additionally, we find that the hysteresis cannot be explained by simple interdot capacitance interactions, 
and electrostatic interactions with the enviournemt, which suggests that other mechanisms are responsible for this observed behaviour.

Run the file:

"TwoD_Master_For_Multiple_Tests.m"
and use GUI for navigation

There are many parameters to play around with,
 and different ways to display the data from these computational experiements.
How ever if you just want to see a demo - hit "Run" to run the script.
Then in the GUI hit "Run_The_Experiment"
This will run the experiment with all the default settings
