This project was made during my third year as an undergraduate student.
It was made to get a better understanding of the shapes and oscillations
which are described by the mathematics of spherical harmonics.
This topic was learned multiple times throughout different physics courses, as it is central for understanding many phenomena found in atomic physics, electromagnetism and any objects that are well described by spherical coordinate systems.

This MATLAB based program comes with a GUI, which lets the user choose the wavenumbers
that generate the different spherical harmonics. After the spherical harmonics are generated the
user can choose between several different realizations of the oscillations. These include:

1. Radial Waves:

## How to use this program
To create your own simulation
1.	Run the file
"Creating_Spherical_Harmonics.m"

2.	Select the wave numbers you wish to generate
3.	After this selection, a short animation is displayed of the selected realization, 
oscillating with the chosen spherical harmonics.
(There is also an option spherical mesh to provide a reference radius, for radial oscillations
and at the end the user can choose to save the video to their computer.)

4.	When the animation has finished running, you can save it as a video in the folder you ran the code from. 
5.	If you do not wish to save the video you can make a new animation with new wavenumbers and new realizations of the waves.
Hope you enjoy!

This project was very fun to work on and it was the first project that I made with the goal of 
sharing it with others. Based on feedback from my friends I tried to make it more intuitive and easier to use. I hope this project will be useful for more students and educators, when learning about spherical harmonics.
