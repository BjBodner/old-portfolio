This was made during my third year as an undergraduate student.
It was made in an attempt to get a better understanding of the shapes and oscillations
which are described by the mathematics of spherical harmonics.
We have reapetitly learned this topic in different courses in physics as it is cerntral for understanding 
many phenomena found in atomic physics, electromagentism and object that are well described by 
spherical coordinate systems.

This Matlab based program comes with a GUI, which lets the user choose the wavenumbers
that generate the different spherical harmonics. After the spherical harmonics are generated the
user can choose between several different realizations of the oscialltions. These include:
1. Radial Waves

2. Spherical Wave function
3. Charge Density Waves

4. Bouncy Ball



Run the file
"Creating_Spherical_Harmonics.m"


After that an short animation is displayed of the selected realization, 
oscillating with the chosen spherical harmonics, 
as well as an optional spherical mesh to provide a reference radius, for radial oscillations
and at the end the user can choose to save the video to their computer.

A video of the gerated spherical hamonics and the realizations they create can be found at:

This project was very fun to make and it was the first project that I made with the goal of 
sharing it with others. Based on feedback from my friends I tried to make it more intuitive and easier to use.
I hope this project will be useful for more students and educators, when learning about spherical harmonics.
