This project was created in my last year as an undergraduate student,
in relation to the first course I took in solid state physics.

The goals of this project was to gain a better understanding of the different phonon bands (Optic and Accoustic)
 that can be observed in a 1D chain of atoms. This project allowed me to et a better understanding of the effects
of finite systems, and how they can change the dispersion relations. It was very helpful in gaining 
a more intuitive understanding of systems with coupled particle, 
and how the different parameters effect the behaviour.
