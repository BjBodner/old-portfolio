This project was created in the beginning of the first year of grad school in the Brown Physics Department.
It was made to try to better understand the pronciple of minimal action.
This was done by visualizing the energy surface made by lagrangians,
 and the space time paths which form from minimizing the actions.
I wanted to see how the lagrangian evolves with time, and how the actions is kept at the minimum.

After running this on a 1D harmonic oscillator, I learned from this simulations that the way this minimization 
can occur over any arbitrary time interval holds, can result from an action that oscillates around the origin.
This was new to me and quite suprising too, but as an afterthought it made sense.

I hope this code will be useful to others and hopefully inspire more students to try to simulate 
the material they learn in class, in an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of it.
