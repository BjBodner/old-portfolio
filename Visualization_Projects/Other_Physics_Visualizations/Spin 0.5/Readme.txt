Folding a ring in on itself

This mimcs the reaction of a spin 1/2 to rotations

However though visually pleasing to watch this 
visualization does not obay the same mathematics as true spin 1/2 particles, such as probabilites of 
measurements on different axis. This means that this visualization does not properly represent these particles.

That sad, this was a good excersise at soothly deforming vector fields, and was quite fun to work on.
I hope this project can be used as a template for more ellaborate deformations, such as in electrostatics.
