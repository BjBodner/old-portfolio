This visualization was made during my final year as an undergraduate in physics, during a course on non-linear dynamics

After learning about different kinds of rate equations, and how the different parameters can totally change
the behaviour that is generate. After the professor explained about slime mold, I attempted to recreate a system
which behaved in an analigous way. 

This simulation deal with a case where we have a 2D system, which contains different densities of slime mold
as well as food for them to grow. there are several different rates involved in this case, such as:
how quickly they deplete the food supply, the rate and distribution that the food grows back, how quickly the mold
dies off, and how the densities of the mold interact with each other.

All these parameters are tunable, and can generate lot of interesting behaviours.
I had a lot of fun generating and playing around with the system parameters.
It definitelly helped me visualize other systems which we studied after this one.

I hope you enjoy playing around with the system parameters as well.

Just run the file:
"Slime_Mold_Master.m" to see the animation
