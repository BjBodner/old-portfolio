This project was made in my last year as an undergraduate, to better understand the propogation and reflection
of particles off a metal-superconductor tunnel junction. 
This visualization of the equations which govern the interface, has helped me understand the different regiemes involved
and gain a better understanding of the effects of the superconducting band gap on the quasiparticles in
the two materials.
