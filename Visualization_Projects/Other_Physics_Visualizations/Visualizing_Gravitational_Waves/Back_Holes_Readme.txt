This project was made during my last year as an undergraduate student.
I made it after learning the mathematics of gravitational waves during my first course on general relativity.
The aim of this project was to see the stretching effects that these kinds of waves have of the spacetime,
as they pass through it.

The simulation looks at a perpandicular plane, and is aimed at visualizing the stretching that occurs when
gravitational waves pass through it. It was aimed at gaining more intuiting of the shapes that form ,
and of the effects of different polerizations that these waves can have.
 
This project has helped me a lot in understanding this material, due to demistifying this phenomena
by converting the complecated equations to simple pictures and animations.
I hope this project will have the same effect for future users.

A video of the animations which are generated by this code, showing different polerizations of the gravitational 
waves can be found at:

The file :
"BlackHoles.m" creates an animation of two black holes rotating each other - which can be viewed from different
angles


The file:
Gravitational wave master
"GravityWaves_Master.m" create an animation of the streatching effect that gravitational waves have
on a surface they pass though - the amplitude is exagurated in this visualization.
