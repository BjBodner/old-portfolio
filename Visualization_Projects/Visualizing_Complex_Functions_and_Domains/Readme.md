# Visualizing Complex functions and domains


Similar to the spherical harmonics project, This project was made to share with others.
It is was made during my last semester as an undergraduate student, while studying complex analysis.
This course was very technical and provided more tools and methods than explanations. 

I made this project in an attempt to gain a better understanding complex functions and complex domains.
In this project I made two way different visual representations of complex functions, one a double 2D surface
and the other as a 2D vector field. 

These Matlab based programs come with a custom made GUIs, which allow the user to choose different complex valued domains 
and functions they with to visualize. when choosing to visualize a function, the program generates a short animation
which the user can then choose to save to their own computer. 
May quastions such as winding numbers can be see immediately around poles as well as the differences between the 
real part and the imaginary parts of these functions. 

This project has helped me greatly in understanding the behaviours of these functinos.
I hope these programs will be used by future students and teachers, to provide a more intuitive and visual
approach to this subject.


The file:
"Plot_Complex_Functions.m" makes the animations of the complex functions

The file 
"Conformal_Transformations.m" makes a visualization of conformal transformations
 you can change functions in the :
"Change the function you want here"

The file:
"Domain_Plotter" - plots a function domain made of equality and ineqallity constraints

The file:
"Mandelbrot.m" simply creates teh mandelbrot set
