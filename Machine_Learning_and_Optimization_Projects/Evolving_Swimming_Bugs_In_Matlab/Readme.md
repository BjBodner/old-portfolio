# Evolving Swimming Bugs In Matlab

This project was aimed at three main goals:
1. creating a simulated enviournment in matlab, which will behave as an aquatic enviournment with high viscosity, for small "creatures".
2. Learning locomotion through this simulated enviournment using  a genetic algorithm to evolve the motions.
3. Having fun.

This project creates "Bugs" which learn to swim through the process of evolution, by using genetic algorithms to evolve
different methods of locomotion.

The bug were trained to generate quite "random" but periodic sequences of movements.
These periodic movements were evolved over several generations, until a pretty good solution is found.
Then the program animates them.

A video of the swimming motions which are generated in this way can be found at:
_____

you can make evolve new "Bugs" using this code.
Simply run "Walking_AI_Master.m" in matlab, and you will see animations of newly made locomotion strategies for these
tiny swimming simulated stick figures.
