# Complex Neural Networks Library

----Note to self - add motivation about complex neural networks, and how they can help different situations

This project was made to try out the concept of using complex valued weights, biases, and activations in neural networks
In an attempt to create more complicated non linear behavious in relatively simple neural network architectures.

This is intended to be a library which can be used as a general source code, to be addapted to specific examples.
It uses a gradient free method of optimizing the networks, which is architecture agnostic
.(you can use any architectre you want).

The python based library is written in numpy, which should hopefully make it easier for others to use it.
I hope to continue to work on this library and add new architectures and
 neural network capabilities to it, such as CNNs, droppout, batch norm, etc/.

I hope this library will be of use to others.
