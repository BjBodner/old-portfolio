# Hamiltonian Learning for monty carlo markov chains

This project was created during the third year of my undergraduate degree.
After working of monty carlo markov  chains in my undergraduate research project, and spending a 
lot of time tuning the parameters of the hamiltonian (Energy function, used for determining the probabilities
of transitionss between states).
This was an attempt to use a genetic algorithm to learn the appropriate parameters of the different
interaction terms of the hamiltonian. 
This was used in a fun setting of creating two teams of interacting particle, with rules of a game for
anihilation of the other teams particles. The training was to try to use a tournament Selection process 
to optimize the parameters which govern the interactions.


Run the File titled : Algorithm_Optimizing_TGA
This will start the tournament of which will be used to determine the "fittness function"
note that you may need to wait a few iterations to see some cool behaviour.
