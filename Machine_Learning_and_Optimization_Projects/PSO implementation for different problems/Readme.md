# PSO Implementations for different problems


This is a collection of several implementations of the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm.
These were written as part of the numerical optimization course on Udemy.
Though the course was taught in matlab, I write the implementations in python, with a few
vectorized additions for better sped.
This code can be used a a source code for different kinds of optimizations in the future.
