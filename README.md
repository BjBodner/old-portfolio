This portfolio is a collection of projects which I have worked on over the past few years. They primarily fall into two main interests of mine:
1. Machine learning and optimization algorithms
2. Visualization of physical and mathematical phenomena


## Machine Learning and Optimization Algorithms:

Overview:

This section presents various machine learning and optimization projects I have worked on over the past few years. 
These consist of independent side projects and research projects, which often complemented each other. 
These projects include several custom-made Complex valued neural networks (Neural networks with complex valued weights, biases, and activation functions), model-based Reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and methods for learning the interaction parameters for monte carlo markov chain simulations. (More on these later). 
The projects were written in python and MATLAB languages and though many of these projects are consist of custom-made algorithms, some of them use deep learning libraries Such as PyTorch, Tensorflow.

As for optimization, my research is currently focused on developing gradient-free optimization algorithms for high dimensional settings, such as those found in deep learning and physical science problems. 
Early implementations of these algorithms can be found in this repository (Such as Guessing Game, Trio, Orchestra). This include the highly versatile ATM optimization algorithm, which is currently in press, and is to be published in the Proceeding to the 2019 Genetic and Evolutionary Computational Conference. The ATM algorithm is currently in the process of being adapted to the commonly used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and Tensorflow. (As of June 2019).
Some of these optimization algorithms have been applied to problems such as optimizing and ensemble
of complex neural networks to classify simulated particle accelerator events which contain HIGGS particles, learning lagrangians of physical systems and learning metamaterial designs which generate desired optical properties.


Here is a list of the machine learning and optimization projects which can be found in this repository:
1. ATM Algorithm

3. Complex Neural Networks Library
4. Evolving Swimming Buggs in MATLAB
5. Generating Simulated Metamaterials Using Genetic algorithms
6. Guessing Game Optimization Algorithm
7. Hamiltonian Learning for Monte Carlo Markov Chains
8. Interacting Complex Networks - CERN Hackathon
9. Learning Lagrangians of physical systems
10. Learning to swim and eat by evolving movements and actions
11. Pinball Optimization Algorithm
12. PSO implementations for different problems
13. Training a DNN on mnist with Pinball
14. Trio Optimization algorithm



## Visualization Projects:

Overview:
These visualization projects are mostly focused on phenomena in physics. In most of these projects equations which generate these behaviors are well defined, but their visual representation is not always immediately obvious (especially when learning them for the first time). These projects were mostly made while I was studying these topics, during my undergraduate courses, in an attempt to gain a more intuitive understanding of them. Though I initially made them for myself, they have been very helpful in teaching these concepts to students during my private tutoring sessions.
The topics span a few topics in physics such as visualizing spherical harmonics, phonon dispersions relations, complex functions/domains and more. I hope you enjoy these projects and that they will help to provide a better intuition about these topics.
