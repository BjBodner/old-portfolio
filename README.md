# Benjamin Jacob Bodner - Portfolio

These are projects which I have worked on over the past few years, which fall into two main interests of mine:
1. Machine learning and optimization algorithms
2. Visualization of physical and mathematical phenomena

# Machine Learning and Optimization Algorithms:

Overview:

This section is a conglomerate of machine learning and optimization projects I have worked on over the past few years. 
Which consists of both side projects and research projects, which often complemented each other. 
They combine several custom made machine learning algorithms such as  DNNs, CNN, and Complex networks (Neural networks
with complex valued weights, biases, and activation functions). As well as learning model parameters
for model based Reenforcement learning, evolving movements with genetic algorithms, and learning
the interaction parameters for the hamiltonian of a monte carlo markov chain simulation.(More on these later). 
The projects were written in python and matlab languages, and some were written in both.
Though many of these projects are made with hand-written algorithms, some use deep learning libraries
Such as pytorch, tensorflow, and matlab pattern recognition module.

As for optimization my recent research (as of June 2019) has been focused on developing gradient-free optimization
algorithms for high dimensional settings, such as those found in deep learning and physical science problems.
Early implementations of these algorithms can be found here (Such as Guessing Game, Trio, Orchestra), 
as well as the highly veristile ATM optimization algorithm which is currently in press, and is to be published in 
the Proceeding to the 2019 Genetic and Evolutionary Computational Conference. The ATM algorithm is currently
in the process of being addapted to the commonly used deep learning frameworks: PyTorch and Tensorflow.
Some of these optimization algorithms have been applied to problems such as optimizing and ensamble
of complex neural networks to classify simulated particle accelerator events which contain HIGGS particles, 
learning lagrangians of physical systems and 
learning non-structures inside metamaterials which generate desired optical properties.

# Visualization Projects:

Overview:
These visualization project are mostly focused on phenomena in physics, where the equations are well defined but their visual representation is not always immediatelly obvious (especially when learning them for the first time). These project were mostly made while I was studying these topics, in my undergraduate courses. Though they were initially made in an attempt to understand the learned material in a more intuitive way, before my course examinations, they have been very useful in teaching these topics to students in private tutoring. The topics span a few topics in physics such as visualizing spherical harmonics, phonon dispersions relations, complex functions/domains and more. I hope you enjoy these project and that they will help create more intuitive understanding of the topics they focus on.
